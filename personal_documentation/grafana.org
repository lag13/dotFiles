** Alerting
If you have an alert like:
- Evaluate every: 1m
- For: 5m
- When avg() of query(A, 24h, now) is above 0


That means that every minute we'll take the average for the past 24
hours. If that average is above 0 then since "For" is set to 5m we'll
wait another 5 minutes and if the average for the past 24 hours at 5
minutes in the future is ALSO above 0 then we say there is an alert
situation.
