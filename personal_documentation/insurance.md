Insurance
=========

Costs
-----

1. Premium - Monthly amount you pay.
2. Deductable - Amount of money you must pay before insurance starts helping
   pay for medical expenses.
3. Coinsurance - After you pay off your deductable, insurance will cover a
   percentage of the costs.
4. Out of pocket limit - This is the maximum limit you have to pay for medical
   expenses. Once this is reached, insurance pays for everything.
