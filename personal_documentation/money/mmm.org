Ideas on saving more and making more
1. Get a costco card and start going to costco on the weekends to buy
   stuff in bulk.
2. In the future look for a place to live that has a low rental cost.
   This is probably the most important one I can do because as it
   stands now my rent accounts for almost 75% of my expenses.
3. Sell some of my stuff on craigslist
   - super nintendo
   - books
   - gamecube
   - etc...
4. Go out to eat a max of 1 time per week.
5. Look for a higher paying job. I'm thinking that I will do this at
   the end of the year.
6. As Tony Robbins puts it, find a way to add more value!! And when I
   say add more value I don't believe you should be searching only for
   profit. Just try to find ways to give back to people at first and
   if it turns into something that makes money great otherwise great!
   - blogs. Some article ideas (some from just my github profiles)
     - Y combinator (perhaps come up with a really cool way to
       programatically generate the examples that I so tediously typed
       myself). If that little programatic way to generate the
       examples is cool enough I could even do an article on that.
     - Haskell's type system and why it is cool
     - Talking about all the snake implementations
     - go all out on fizzbuzz and implement different solutions
     - talk about my dislike of mocks and that functional
       transformations should be the most important things to keep in
       mind
     - Create a little y combinator based bit of obfuscated code to
       display my email and github that could be put on a resume.
       Could we even do it in bash??? Thanks to my train buddy for
       that idea!
     - Create a tutorial on investing and the different types of
       investments. As part of that tutorial write a lot of code to
       *really* show the hard numbers backing all this stuff.
     - Contact that vim hacker that I helped a while ago when I
       extended his surround plugin for backwards compatability to see
       if he has anything I could help with.
     - Write a program to help with writing Diary entries. It could
       hold more structured data which could make it more easily
       searchable. Talk with Joe about this.
   - Teach things to friends just to see what that feels like. It
     could turn into some tutoring on the side.
   - Work part time somewhere. Perhaps Robert's Clojure company would
     be willing to let me work part time for instance.
   - Learn data analysis, it could be useful somewhere
   - Zach Anderson had mentioned some sort of track software that he
     thought would be nice to have. Contact him and see if we could
     build it.
   - Jason Kirk had an idea for sort of a facebook for research papers
     where everything was open. Talk to him and start building that.
   - I'm starting credit card churning and I wonder if I could create
     a site to help people manage the credit cards that they have
     open. Could do useful things like send them alerts or give them
     an estimate of how much money the need to spend per day. If I
     could somehow track their spending then that would be awesome
     too.
7. Keep reading financial books and just try to understand investing
   your money in general.
8. Ask friends and family what their investment portfolio looks like
   in an effort to build the "best" portfolio for me.
9. Use public transportation less. Walk or bike instead.
10. Come up with a couple cheap recipes. Ideally easy as well. I'm
    picturing something with potatoes. I believe MMM has some
    reccomendations so that's a place to start.
11. Consider some sort of pay as you go cellphone plan. I'll plan to
    talk with parents and others on skype or through some other free
    means.
12. Look into a credit card which offers more cash back:
    https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/cash-back/. It looks like
    there are a lot of cards which could really put more money back
    into my pocket. Also google MMM on credit cards. It sounds like
    there is a community of people who start lots of credit cards just
    to get the rewards. Also https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/
13. Look into investing my HSA
14. Look into "pre-tax transit" benefit offered by CB. Could net me
    some extra free cash.
15. Get my frequent flyer mile stuff straightened out. Why would I
    turn down free flights???
16. Start using mint to track all my spending and accounts (it could
    include credit cards, neat!)

TODO: I want to know what MMM's portfolio looks like. Does he
literally have everything in stocks? Does he have some bonds funds
which he lives off of when times are tough and otherwise he's got
stocks? Part of that curiosity stems from the fact that relying purely
on stock as a source of retirement income seems bad in the scenario
that the stock market plummets but you still need to rely on a source
of income. In such situations it feels like you *need* some sort of
steadier income source that you can rely on such as bonds.

TODO: Why wouldn't you want to invest in something that pays higher
dividends? This article talks about that:
- http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/12/22/guest-posting-from-dividend-mantra-what-is-dividend-growth-investing/
- https://jlcollinsnh.com/2011/12/27/dividend-growth-investing/
At the very least it feels like that growth would be more stable long
term. I also don't understand why you're growth wouldn't be *larger*
long term because you could reinvest those dividends back into the
stock.
