Good API == Good For Business
=============================

- Good For Business:
  - Good For clients/customers
    - Clients can use these API's quickly and can use them to do anything they
      want. A happy external client means they enjoy your business and will
      come back meaning more revenue. A happy internal client means tools can
      be made more quickly and those tools will probably get used by external
      clients who become happy and generate more revenue.
    - As a special case, one of your clients could be the front end of the
      application itself. This makes the front end very flexible (you can just
      use the API's you need to get things done). Also it can make it quick to
      develop new UX features because they can use whatever tool they want and
      a lot of good tools have bubbled up lately.
  - Good for employees because they are happier because the code base is nicer
    to work with.
