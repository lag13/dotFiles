API
===

API is actually a pretty general term. Ususally we might think about an API
being related to http requests but I think it is really any interface to any
system. Examples of APIs:

1. vim configuration/scripting is an API for the vim editor.
2. emacs configuration/scripting is an API for the emacs editor.
3. Java code is an interface for java bytecode which is an API for a JVM.
4. C code is an API for assembly.
5. Assembly is an API for hardware functionality.
6. An http request to a server.
