Snarky Comment
--------------

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15056878/rest-vs-json-rpc

The first comment on this response probably perfectly sums up my frustration
with REST: http://stackoverflow.com/a/20643993. Basically REST specifications
seem sort of arbitrary sometimes and then some guy comes along and says this:

```
This answer shows the all-too usual misconception of what REST actually is.
REST is definitely not just a mapping of CRUD to HTTP methods. The idea that
it is a problem to "add another method" clearly indicates that REST is
misunderstood as RPC over HTTP, which it is not at all. Try reading Roy
Fieldings blog or his dissertation - Google will help you find it - you are
not describing REST at all in your answer.
```

Now maybe this guy is right (I haven't read Roy Fielding's discertaion and
maybe I should: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)
but the fact is based on most of the tutorials and such that I've looked at,
almost everyone thinks of REST as being a consitent approach to doing CRUD
operations and instead of making some snarky comment about "oh, you don't
really understand how rest works" it should be more constructive or something.
