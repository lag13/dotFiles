Info
====

So I've been using `man` for as long as I can remember. Turns out there is also an `info` command who's primary purpose is apparently to read "Info" documents. The GNU project distributes many of it's manuals in the Info format and emacs has an info reader built into it. Neat!

I've tried calling `info` on a couple "standard" commands and it seems to work. It seems to display the same stuff as `man` most of the time.
