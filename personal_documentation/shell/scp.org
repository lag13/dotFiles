When specifying the recursive option the directory specified on the
left side will be placed INSIDE the directory on the right side:

scp -r root@10.1.41.130:/root/lucas-test-dir /home/ec2-user/

The result of the above command will be the folder
/home/ec2-user/lucas-test-dir being created. If the folder
/home/ec2-user/lucas-test-dir already exists then matching files being
copied over will replace the files already existing and their
timestamps will be updated (i.e. there is no smart checking of "is
this file different, if so copy the file" which makes sense). Files
Other files already in /home/ec2-user/lucas-test-dir will be left
alone.

If you're copying a lot of files though you're better off using rsync
as it will only copy what needs to be copied:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Copies the ENTIRE directory src_dir INTO dest_dir meaning the
  # structure will be like dest_dir/src_dir. Also creates dest_dir if it
  # does not exist
  rsync --archive --progress src_dir dest_dir

  # Copies the CONTENTS of src_dir in to dest_dir and also creates it if
  # it doesn't exist
  rsync -a --progress src_dir/ dest_dir

  # Either way, unless you're copying individual files (like if you
  # specify one file or if you use a '*') rsync will be putting it
  # inside of a directory called dest_dir.

  # Specify what ssh thing to use. Also, do NOT use --compress unless
  # the network connection is really bad, I was once copying files
  # between EC2 instance on AWS and with --compress it took ~50 seconds
  # for 1GB but without --compress it only took ~15 seconds.
  rsync --archive --progress --rsh "ssh -i ~/.ssh/infrastructure.pem" ec2-user@10.10.62.64:/home/ec2-user/lucas-test-dir .
