When specifying the recursive option the directory specified on the
left side will be placed INSIDE the directory on the right side:

scp -r root@10.1.41.130:/root/lucas-test-dir /home/ec2-user/

The result of the above command will be the folder
/home/ec2-user/lucas-test-dir being created. If the folder
/home/ec2-user/lucas-test-dir already exists then matching files being
copied over will replace the files already existing and their
timestamps will be updated (i.e. there is no smart checking of "is
this file different, if so copy the file" which makes sense). Files
Other files already in /home/ec2-user/lucas-test-dir will be left
alone.

If you're copying a lot of files though you're better off using rsync
as it will only copy what needs to be copied.
