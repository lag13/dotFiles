* sites-enabled vs. sites-available
These are where the vhost files go. Anything in sites-enabled is a
vhost that is visible to apache. Basically, and this seems to hold for
other similarly named files, "available" holds actual files and
"enabled" holds symlinks to those files. I think that makes it simpler
to "kill" a vhost if the site is misbehaving (because you just remove
the symlink) and its sort of a separation of deployment vs moving
things to the newly deployed "thing":
