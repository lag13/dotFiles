Dealing with errors in programming.

* Errors are in the eye of the beholder
The word "error" in programming means that something "went wrong" with
your code. It feels like it would be easy to tell when something "went
wrong" with your program but it can actually be quite tricky because
whether or not something is an error all depends on your *perspective*
which is probably not something that apparent within your source code.

Here's an example of errors not being so cut and dry. When sending
data across the internet to another service you would *think* that if
the data fails to get ther then that is an error. But that assumption
would be wrong. For example the UDP protocol itself was built around
the notion that it does *not* care whether the data gets there or not.

* Conclusion
When considering whether or not something should be an error consider
it from the point of view of the code being written. Think about what
this code does as well as *who* will be calling it.
