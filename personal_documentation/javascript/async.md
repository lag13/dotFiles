Callbacks, Promises, Observables oh my!
=======================================

I'm trying to write an angular 2 application and am getting confused because
they use observables and I don't really understand them and to understand them
I feel like I should understand promises first and then I just wanted a review
of callback functions.

Type "angular 2 reactive programming" into google. When doing that this third
link: http://espeo.eu/blog/angular-2-reactive-programming-rxjs/ has useful
information (and links) to informations about callbacks, promises, and
observables. Some of the links:

- http://callbackhell.com/
- https://www.promisejs.org/implementing/

This is another article about callback functions which I liked:

Talks about promises arriving natively to javascript:

call on other technologies which are:
