Wordpress
=========

So I made a publically available website today (09/18/2016)! I just used the
wordpress site and when creating the site I was able to create my own domain
name (for a fee) and they host it. I'm not sure how much flexibility/freedom I
get from wordpress in terms of writing my own html/css/javascript but I guess
I'll see. I wonder if I can write an API? I'm thinking not.

Some themes I tried:
