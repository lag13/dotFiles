# Environment variables can have newlines in them. ECS parameter store
# values can also have newlines in them BUT if you are using the UI
# and are trying to add newlines to values of type "SecureString" then
# it does not work: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/2596.
# Seriously, if you try to hit <return> in the UI then nothing
# changes. What seems even stranger to me though is that if you paste
# text containing newlines then each newline gets converted to a
# <space> character (and what REALLY bugs me about the UX is that even
# if a value has newlines in it, when you see the value from the list
# view then the newlines get converted to spaces). So the only way to
# add newlines to a value of type "SecureString" (which you probably
# want for things like RSA private keys) is through the aws command
# line:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-su-create.html#param-create-cli-securestring

# Unfortunately, when trying to use the aws CLI to add RSA keys I ran
# into difficulties. First off, it appears that the documentation and
# our version of the CLI are out of sync (I did not see
# "put-parameter" as an available command). Secondly when trying to
# run other "aws ssm" commands such as "list-commands" I got a
# permission error. Since I figure it will be annoying to try and sort
# that out AND because it feels nice that we are consistent and update
# all environment variables through the UI, this means we need to
# convert a RSA private key with spaces into one with newlines. i.e.
# convert this:

# -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- content content -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

# to this:

# -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
# content
# content
# -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

# This bash accomplishes that. The first sed script adds a newline
# after the "BEGIN RSA" bit and before the "END RSA" bit then the
# second sed script adds newlines for all the content.
