Vagrant is a way to spin up virtual machines and provision said
machines with whatever software is necessary. I think it can then
distribute the resulting image for deployment. In some ways it feels
like it glues together 2 things (and all of these things are specified
in a file called Vagrantfile so it can be reproduced elsewhere):
1. Hypervisor software (e.g. virtual box) - is capable of running a VM
2. Configuration management software (e.g. shell script, ansible,
   chef, puppet, etc...) - software that can be used to install any
   necessary software onto a computer

A Vagrantfile is written in ruby (not sure why this is)

This is a nice little tutorial on vagrant where he sets up a LAMP
stack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBreXjkizgo. This guy seems
like a solid tutorial person actually, I'll have to check out some of
his other stuff.
