My Vim Configuration
====================

I started working on multiple machines and wanted to share my vim
configuration. I saw this video on vimcasts and wanted to try it out:
http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/

Installation:
-------------
    
### Clone The Repository


### Create symlinks


### Initialize The git-submodules
